# Introduction to JavaScript & jQuery Workshop

Want to get up to speed on JavaScript, one of the most popular languages on the web?
This workshop will introduce you to some of the basics of programming and then move into JavaScript fundamentals and how they apply to jQuery.
Once the foundation is laid, we'll begin building a client-side contacts manager app that will expose best practices and why they exist.
Time willing, we'll look at bringing even better structure to the contacts app by converting it to Backbone.js.
This workshop will arm you with the knowledge to help debug your existing JavaScript code and how to write modular and performant JavaScript in the future.
