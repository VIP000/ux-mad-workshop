## Baseline Exercise
  - exercise: http://jsfiddle.net/todoubled/qaynT/
  - solution: http://jsfiddle.net/todoubled/VGLw8/

## Use Cases
  - originally developed for form validation
  - great for polyfills, it's really relevant for you
  - complex animations and interactive content
  - commonly used for client side A/B testing

## Pros
  - JS runs in every browser everywhere
  - Leads to more interactive, user friendly UIs
  - More naturally event driven. Do this when that happens.

## Cons
  - JS executes on foreign hardware, out of your control
  - More exists so more is bound to go wrong
  - Event model can warp your brain

## Programming Basics
  - Follow along with the jsfiddle example

## Philosophies
  - More important to be clear and obvious than clever
  - Do one thing and one thing well. Tiny functions that work together
  - Don't Repeat Yourself

## Vocabulary

## Syntax

## Types

## Functions & Arguments
  - functions execute code on demand
  - arguments abstract functions and make them reuseable

## Conditionals
  - allows you to fork the code path determined by business logic
  - 3 types of conditional statements

## Exercise Tips
  - Use jsfiddle and tweet solutions at me
  - Use console.log to debug and prove solution
  - Keep functions small and focused
  - Think about name and purpose before coding
  - First make it work, then make it work well

## Exercise #2 (build user object from email string)
